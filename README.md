_metadata-extractor_ is a straightforward Java library for reading metadata from image files.

    Metadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(imagePath);

With that `metadata` object, you can [iterate or query](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/wiki/GettingStarted#2._Query_Tag_s) the
[various tag values](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/wiki/SampleOutput) that were read from the image.

The library understands several formats of metadata, many of which may be present in a single image:

* [Exif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format)
* [IPTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTC)
* [XMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Metadata_Platform)
* [JFIF / JFXX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_File_Interchange_Format)
* [ICC Profiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile)
* [Photoshop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoshop) fields
* [PNG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) properties
* [BMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format) properties
* [GIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format) properties

It will process files of type:

* JPEG
* TIFF
* PSD
* PNG
* BMP
* GIF
* Camera Raw (NEF/CR2/ORF/ARW/RW2/...)

Special camera-specific data is decoded for most cameras manufactured by:

* Agfa
* Canon
* Casio
* Epson
* Fujifilm
* Kodak
* Kyocera
* Leica
* Minolta
* Nikon
* Olympus
* Panasonic
* Pentax
* Sanyo
* Sigma/Foveon
* Sony
